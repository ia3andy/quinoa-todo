Sharing React components between projects is a very effective way to speed your app development and to ensure UI consistency.

Today, thanks to powerful tools like  Bit, it becomes much easier to share React components and, as a great side effect, build a stunning reusable UI library.

Sharing a component from any app or project becomes a simple process of using Bit to add, tag and export components to your reusable collection.

Each component you share can be quickly used in different apps, and will from now-on always be available for reuse. You will also get auto-docs, a visual sandbox and much more out of the box. And, it plays with npm and yarn so you can install components just like any other package.
